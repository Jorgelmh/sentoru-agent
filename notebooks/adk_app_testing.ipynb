This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion, as well as potential bypass of authentication. This aligns with the description of injection-type flaws and SQL injection vulnerabilities mentioned in the provided sources, which highlight the importance of proper input sanitization to prevent such attacks.\\n\\n**Recommendation**:\\nTo mitigate the SQL Injection vulnerability, use parameterized queries (prepared statements) provided by `aiosqlite`. This separates the SQL code from user-supplied data, preventing malicious input from being interpreted as executable SQL.\\n\\n**Corrected Code Example**:\\n```python\\n@app.get(\"/users/{username}\")\\nasync def get_user(username: str):\\n    db = await aiosqlite.connect(\\'users.db\\')\\n    cursor = await db.cursor()\\n    await cursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?\", (username,))\\n    user = await cursor.fetchone()\\n    await db.close()\\n\\n    if user:\\n        return {\"username\": user[0], \"email\": user[1]}\\n    else:\\n        return {\"error\": \"User not found\"}\\n```'}],\n",

Even for sophisticated attacks that may focus on compromising upstream suppliers, individual organization can take reasonable steps to defend its own assets and mitigate risk even if its supplier is compromised. Although some parts of SSCS may remain outside direct control of development teams, those teams must still do their part to improve SSCS in their organization; the guidance below is intended as starting point for developers to do just that.\\n\\nGeneral\\nThe practices described below are general techniques that can be used to mitigate risk related to a wide variety of threat types.\\n\\nImplement Strong Access Control\\n  Compromised accounts, particularly privileged ones, represents a significant threats to SSCs. Account takeover can allow an attacker can perform a variety of malicious acts including injecting code into legitimate dependencies, manipulating CI/CD pipeline execution, and replacing a benign artifact with a malicious one. Strong access control for build, development, version control, and similar environments is thus critical. Best practices include adhering to  the basic security principles of least privileges and separation of duties, enforcing MFA, rotating credentials, and ensuring credentials are never stored or transmitted in clear text or committed to source control.\\n\\nLogging and Monitoring\\n  When considering SSCS, the importance of detective controls should not be overlooked; these controls are essential for detecting attacks and enabling prompt respond. In the context of SSCS, logging is critical. All systems involved in the SSC, including VCS, build tools, delivery mechanisms, artifact repositories, and the systems responsible for running applications should be configured to log authentication attempts, configuration changes, and other events that could assist in identifying anomalous behavior or that could prove crucial for incident response efforts. Logs throughout the SSC must be sufficient in both depth and breadth to support detection and response\\n  However, logging events is not sufficient. These logs must be monitored, and, if necessary, acted upon. A centralized SIEM, log aggregator, or similar tool is preferred, especially given the complexity of SSCs. Regardless of the technology used, the basic objective remains the same: log data should be actionable.\\n\\nLeverage Security Automation\\nFor complex SSCs, automation of security tasks, such as scanning, monitoring, and testing is critical. Such automation, while not a replacement for manual reviews and other actions performed by skilled professionals, is capable of detecting, and in some cases responding to, vulnerabilities and potential attacks with a scale and consistency that is hard to achieve through manual human intervention. Types of tools that support automation include SAST, DAST, SCA, container image scanners and more. The exact tools most capable of delivering value to an organization will vary significantly based on the characteristics of the organization. However, regardless of the type of tools and vendors used, it is important to acknowledge that these tools themselves must be mainlined, secured, and configured correctly. Failure to do so could actually increase SSC risk for an organization, or at the very least, fail to bring meaningful benefit to the organization. Finally, it must be clearly understood that these tools are but one component of an overall SSCS program; they cannot be considered a comprehensive solution or be relied on to identify all vulnerabilities.\\n\\nMitigating Source Code Threats\\nThe practices described below can help reduce SSC risk associated with source code and development.\\n\\nPeer Reviews\\nManual code reviews are an important, relatively low cost technique for reducing SSC risk; these reviews can act as both detective controls and deterrents. Reviews should be performed by peers possessing both experience in the technology being used and secure coding processes and should occur before code is merged within a source control systems [3]. The reviews should look for both unintentional security flaws as well as intentional code that could serve malicious purposes. The results of the review should be documented for later review if needed.\\n\\nSecure Config of Version Control Systems\\nCompromise or abuse of the source control system is consistently recognized as a significant SSC risk [4,5]. The general security best practices of strong access control and logging and monitoring are two methods to help secure VCS. Security features specific to the VCS system, such as protected branches and merge policies in git, should also be leveraged. You can find a wide variety of recommended policies in this documentation. There are tools available to help manage configuration of SCM systems, such as Legitify, an open-source tool by Legit security. Legitify is designed to detect misconfigurations in GitHub and GitLab and assist with the implementation of best practices. Regardless of any security controls added a VCS, it must be remember that secrets should never be committed to these systems.'},\n",

The results of the review should be documented for later review if needed.\\n\\nSecure Config of Version Control Systems\\nCompromise or abuse of the source control system is consistently recognized as a significant SSC risk [4,5]. The general security best practices of strong access control and logging and monitoring are two methods to help secure VCS. Security features specific to the VCS system, such as protected branches and merge policies in git, should also be leveraged. You can find a wide variety of recommended policies in this documentation. There are tools available to help manage configuration of SCM systems, such as Legitify, an open-source tool by Legit security. Legitify is designed to detect misconfigurations in GitHub and GitLab and assist with the implementation of best practices. Regardless of any security controls added a VCS, it must be remember that secrets should never be committed to these systems.',\n",

       "    {'retrieved_context': {'rag_chunk': {'text': 'Reactive Identification\\nThere are three main reactive methods for identifying vulnerabilities:\\n- **Vendor contact (e.g. pre-warning)** - Occurs when a vendor discloses a vulnerability for commercial web application software that you are using. Example is Microsoft\\'s Active Protections Program (MAPP)\\n- **Public disclosure** - Public vulnerability disclosure for commercial/open source web application software that you are using. The threat level for public disclosure is increased as more people know about the vulnerability.\\n- **Security incident** – This is the most urgent situation as the attack is active. In these situations, remediation must be immediate.\\n\\nAnalysis Phase\\nHere are the recommended steps to start the analysis phase:\\n1. **Determine Virtual Patching Applicability** - Virtual patching is ideally suited for injection-type flaws but may not provide an adequate level of attack surface reduction for other attack types or categories. Thorough analysis of the underlying flaw should be conducted to determine if the virtual patching tool has adequate detection logic capabilities.\\n2. **Utilize Bug Tracking/Ticketing System** - Enter the vulnerability information into a bug tracking system for tracking purposes and metrics. Recommend you use ticketing systems you already use such as Jira or you may use a specialized tool such as ThreadFix.\\n3. **Verify the name of the vulnerability** - This means that you need to have the proper public vulnerability identifier (such as CVE name/number) specified by the vulnerability announcement, vulnerability scan, etc. If the vulnerability is identified proactively rather than through public announcements, then you should assign your own unique identifier to each vulnerability.\\n4. **Designate the impact level** - It is always important to understand the level of criticality involved with a web vulnerability. Information leakages may not be treated in the same manner as an SQL Injection issue.\\n5. **Specify which versions of software are impacted** - You need to identify what versions of software are listed so that you can determine if the version(s) you have installed are affected.\\n6. **List what configuration is required to trigger the problem** - Some vulnerabilities may only manifest themselves under certain configuration settings.\\n7. **List Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code or payloads used during attacks/testing** - Many vulnerability announcements have accompanying exploit code that shows how to demonstrate the vulnerability. If this data is available, make sure to download it for analysis. This will be useful later on when both developing and testing the virtual patch.\\n\\nVirtual Patch Creation Phase\\nThe process of creating an accurate virtual patch is bound by two main tenants:\\n1. **No false positives** - Do not ever block legitimate traffic under any circumstances.\\n2. **No false negatives** - Do not ever miss attacks, even when the attacker intentionally tries to evade detection.\\nCare should be taken to attempt to minimize either of these two rules. It may not be possible to adhere 100% to each of these goals but remember that virtual patching is about **Risk Reduction**. It should be understood by business owners that while you are gaining the advantage of shortening the Time-to-Fix metric, you may not be implementing a complete fix for the flaw.\\n\\nManual Virtual Patch Creation\\n\\n\\nPositive Security (Allow List) Virtual Patches (**Recommended Solution**)\\nPositive security model (allowlist) is a comprehensive security mechanism that provides an independent input validation envelope to an application. The model specifies the characteristics of valid input (character set, length, etc…) and denies anything that does not conform.

If you have implemented proper audit logging as part of the Preparation Phase, then you should be able to review audit logs to identify the format of expected input types. In this case, the `reqID` parameter is supposed to only hold integer characters so we can use this virtual patch:\\n```text\\n##\\n## Verify we only receive 1 parameter called \"reqID\"\\n##\\nSecRule REQUEST_URI \"@contains /wp-content/plugins/levelfourstorefront/scripts/administration/exportsubscribers.php\" \"chain,id:1,phase:2,t:none,t:Utf8toUnicode,t:urlDecodeUni,t:normalizePathWin,t:lowercase,block,msg:\\'Input Validation Error for \\\\\\'reqID\\\\\\' parameter - Duplicate Parameters Names Seen.\\',logdata:\\'%{matched_var}\\'\"\\n  SecRule &ARGS:/reqID/ \"!'},\n",
       "      'text': 'Reactive Identification\\nThere are three main reactive methods for identifying vulnerabilities:\\n- **Vendor contact (e.g. pre-warning)** - Occurs when a vendor discloses a vulnerability for commercial web application software that you are using. Example is Microsoft\\'s Active Protections Program (MAPP)\\n- **Public disclosure** - Public vulnerability disclosure for commercial/open source web application software that you are using. The threat level for public disclosure is increased as more people know about the vulnerability.\\n- **Security incident** – This is the most urgent situation as the attack is active. In these situations, remediation must be immediate.\\n\\nAnalysis Phase\\nHere are the recommended steps to start the analysis phase:\\n1. **Determine Virtual Patching Applicability** - Virtual patching is ideally suited for injection-type flaws but may not provide an adequate level of attack surface reduction for other attack types or categories. Thorough analysis of the underlying flaw should be conducted to determine if the virtual patching tool has adequate detection logic capabilities.\\n2. **Utilize Bug Tracking/Ticketing System** - Enter the vulnerability information into a bug tracking system for tracking purposes and metrics. Recommend you use ticketing systems you already use such as Jira or you may use a specialized tool such as ThreadFix.\\n3. **Verify the name of the vulnerability** - This means that you need to have the proper public vulnerability identifier (such as CVE name/number) specified by the vulnerability announcement, vulnerability scan, etc. If the vulnerability is identified proactively rather than through public announcements, then you should assign your own unique identifier to each vulnerability.\\n4. **Designate the impact level** - It is always important to understand the level of criticality involved with a web vulnerability. Information leakages may not be treated in the same manner as an SQL Injection issue.\\n5. **Specify which versions of software are impacted** - You need to identify what versions of software are listed so that you can determine if the version(s) you have installed are affected.\\n6. **List what configuration is required to trigger the problem** - Some vulnerabilities may only manifest themselves under certain configuration settings.\\n7. **List Proof of Concept (PoC) exploit code or payloads used during attacks/testing** - Many vulnerability announcements have accompanying exploit code that shows how to demonstrate the vulnerability. If this data is available, make sure to download it for analysis. This will be useful later on when both developing and testing the virtual patch.\\n\\nVirtual Patch Creation Phase\\nThe process of creating an accurate virtual patch is bound by two main tenants:\\n1. **No false positives** - Do not ever block legitimate traffic under any circumstances.\\n2. **No false negatives** - Do not ever miss attacks, even when the attacker intentionally tries to evade detection.\\nCare should be taken to attempt to minimize either of these two rules. It may not be possible to adhere 100% to each of these goals but remember that virtual patching is about **Risk Reduction**. It should be understood by business owners that while you are gaining the advantage of shortening the Time-to-Fix metric, you may not be implementing a complete fix for the flaw.\\n\\nManual Virtual Patch Creation\\n\\n\\nPositive Security (Allow List) Virtual Patches (**Recommended Solution**)\\nPositive security model (allowlist) is a comprehensive security mechanism that provides an independent input validation envelope to an application. The model specifies the characteristics of valid input (character set, length, etc…) and denies anything that does not conform. By defining rules for every parameter in every page in the application the application is protected by an additional security envelop independent from its code.\\n\\nExample Allow List ModSecurity Virtual Patch\\nIn order to create an allow-list virtual patch, you must be able to verify what the normal, expected input values are.

You need to do a number of things to setup the virtual patching processes and framework **prior** to actually having to deal with an identified vulnerability, or worse yet, react to a live web application intrusion. The point is that during a live compromise is not the ideal time to be proposing installation of a web application firewall and the concept of a virtual patch. Tension is high during real incidents and time is of the essence, so lay the foundation of virtual patching when the waters are calm and get everything in place and ready to go when an incident does occur.\\nHere are a few critical items that should be addressed during the preparation phase:\\n- **Public/Vendor Vulnerability Monitoring** - Ensure that you are signed up for all vendor alert mail-lists for commercial software that you are using. This will ensure that you will be notified in the event that the vendor releases vulnerability information and patching data.\\n- **Virtual Patching Pre-Authorization** – Virtual Patches need to be implemented quickly so the normal governance processes and authorizations steps for standard software patches need to be expedited. Since virtual patches are not actually modifying source code, they do not require the same amount of regression testing as normal software patches. Categorizing virtual patches in the same group as Anti-Virus updates or Network IDS signatures helps to speed up the authorization process and minimize extended testing phases.\\n- **Deploy Virtual Patching Tool In Advance** - As time is critical during incident response, it would be a poor time to have to get approvals to install new software. For instance, you can install ModSecurity WAF in embedded mode on your Apache servers, or an Apache reverse proxy server. The advantage with this deployment is that you can create fixes for non-Apache back-end servers. Even if you do not use ModSecurity under normal circumstances, it is best to have it \"on deck\" ready to be enabled if need be.\\n- **Increase HTTP Audit Logging** – The standard Common Log Format (CLF) utilized by most web servers does not provide adequate data for conducting proper incident response. You need to have access to the following HTTP data:\\n    - Request URI (including QUERY_STRING)\\n    - Full Request Headers (including Cookies)\\n    - Full Request Body (POST payload)\\n    - Full Response Headers\\n    - Full Response Body\\n\\nIdentification Phase\\nThe Identification Phase occurs when an organization becomes aware of a vulnerability within their web application.

       " 'explanation': \"These penetration tests are designed to verify the effectiveness of the SQL Injection fix implemented using parameterized queries. The tests cover various common SQL injection attack vectors, including attempts to use 'OR' clauses, 'UNION SELECT' statements, 'DROP TABLE' commands, and stacked queries for data insertion. For each attack, the expected outcome after the fix is that the malicious payload is treated as a literal username, resulting in a 'User not found' response, and crucially, no unauthorized database operations (like data leakage or table drops) occur. A test for legitimate user retrieval is also included to ensure the fix does not introduce regressions. The use of an in-memory database and `unittest.mock.patch` ensures test isolation and a controlled environment for database interactions.\"}"
