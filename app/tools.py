    """Create a RAG-based tool for retrieving cybersecurity knowledge and best
    practices.

    This tool provides access to a curated knowledge base of security vulnerabilities,
    best practices, and remediation guidance using Vertex AI's Retrieval-Augmented
    Generation (RAG) capabilities. It searches through comprehensive security
    documentation to find relevant information based on code changes.

    The tool is designed to enhance security analysis by providing contextual
    information about:
    - OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies
    - Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database entries
    - Python-specific security issues and solutions
    - General secure coding best practices and guidelines
    - Industry-standard security frameworks and methodologies

    Configuration:
    - similarity_top_k=10: Returns up to 10 most relevant documents
    - vector_distance_threshold=0.6: Filters for documents with â‰¥60% similarity
    - Uses semantic search to find contextually relevant security information

    Returns:
        VertexAiRagRetrieval: Configured RAG tool for vulnerability knowledge
            retrieval that can be used by security analysis agents.

    Environment Variables:
        VULN_RAG_CORPUS (str): The Vertex AI RAG corpus ID containing the
            security knowledge base. This corpus should be pre-populated
            with cybersecurity documentation and best practices.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If VULN_RAG_CORPUS environment variable is not set.
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to Vertex AI RAG service.

    Example:
        When analyzing code with potential SQL injection:

        Query: "SQL injection in Python database queries"

        Response: Documents about parameterized queries, ORM usage,
        input validation, and specific Python libraries for safe DB access.

    Note:
        The RAG corpus should be regularly updated with the latest security
        advisories and best practices to ensure current and relevant responses.

def get_safety_API_tool() -> MCPToolset:
    """Create a tool for scanning project dependencies using the Safety CLI API.

    The Safety API tool provides comprehensive dependency vulnerability scanning
    by checking project dependencies (from requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, etc.)
    against Safety's extensive database of known security vulnerabilities. This
    tool is essential for identifying vulnerable packages and understanding the
    security posture of third-party dependencies.

    Key Features:
    - Scans Python package dependencies for known CVE vulnerabilities
    - Provides detailed vulnerability information including severity ratings
    - Suggests specific package version updates to resolve security issues
    - Integrates with the comprehensive Safety CLI vulnerability database
    - Supports multiple dependency file formats (requirements.txt, Pipfile, etc.)
    - Provides actionable remediation recommendations

    The tool uses Model Context Protocol (MCP) over Server-Sent Events (SSE)
    to communicate with the Safety CLI service, enabling real-time vulnerability
    scanning and reporting.

    Returns:
        MCPToolset: Configured MCP toolset for Safety API access that provides
            dependency vulnerability scanning capabilities.

    Environment Variables:
        SAFETY_API_KEY (str): Bearer token for authenticating with the Safety CLI
            API service. Obtain this from https://safetycli.com/

    Raises:
        ValueError: If SAFETY_API_KEY environment variable is not set.
        ConnectionError: If unable to connect to Safety CLI service.
        AuthenticationError: If the provided API key is invalid.

    API Endpoint:
        - URL: https://mcp.safetycli.com/sse
        - Protocol: Server-Sent Events (SSE) over HTTPS
        - Authentication: Bearer token via Authorization header

    Example Usage:
        When scanning a requirements.txt file containing:
        ```
        django==2.0.0
        requests==2.20.0
        ```
